# Diamonds-Data-Exploration

 This work has been done with a great help from **Udacity** provided by the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Information on the Diamond Dataset

 The dataset can be found in the repository for R's ggplot2 library [here](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/data-raw/diamonds.csv), with feature documentation available [here](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html).

The dataset consists of almost 54,000 rows and 10 columns:

- **price**: Price in dollars. Data was collected in 2008.
- **carat**: Diamond weight. 1 carat is equal to 0.2 grams.
- **cut**: Quality of diamond cut, affects its shine. Grades go from (low) Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal (best).
- **color**: Measure of diamond coloration. Increasing grades go from (some color) J, I, H, G, F, E, D (colorless).
- **clarity**: Measure of diamond inclusions. Increasing grades go from (inclusions) I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (internally flawless).
- **x**, **y**, **z**: Diamond length, width, and depth, respectively, in mm.
- **table**: Ratio of width of top face of diamond to its overall width, as a percentage.
- **depth**: Proportional depth of diamond, as a percentage. This is computed as 2 * z / (x + y), or the ratio of the depth to the average of length and width.
